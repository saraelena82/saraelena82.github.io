  abstract = {Aggressive text detection in social networks allows to identify offenses
	and misbehavior, and leverages tasks such as cyberbullying detection.
	We propose to automatically map a document with an aggressiveness
	score (thus treating aggressive text detection as a regression problem)
	and explore different approaches for this purpose. These include
	lexicon-based, supervised, fuzzy, and statistical approaches. We
	test the different methods over a dataset extracted from Twitter
	and compare them against human evaluation. Our results favor approaches
	that consider several features (particularly the presence of swear
	or profane words).},
