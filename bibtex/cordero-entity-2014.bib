  abstract = {We propose a system for automatic detection of duplicate entries in
	a repository of semi-structured text documents. The proposed system
	employs text-entity recognition to extract information regarding
	time, location, names of persons and organizations, as well as events
	described within the document content. With structured representations
	of the content, called “metamodels”, we group the entries into clusters
	based on the similarity of the contents. Then we apply machine-learning
	algorithms to the clusters to carry out duplicate detection. We present
	results regarding precision, recall, and F-value of the proposed
	system.},
