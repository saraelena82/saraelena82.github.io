  abstract = {Evaluating the knowledge that an individual or group has over a specific
	domain is an important—yet challenging—task. Natural semantic networks
	have been used to capture the long-term knowledge of a group of subjects
	with respect to a particular topic, and allow to assess a group’s
	level of expertise by comparing its network against a network collected
	from experts. While approaches for making this comparison usually
	rely on a qualitative appreciation, our approach is quantitative,
	since it provides a degree of similarity between pairs of networks
	by means of graph theory and information retrieval. We show the feasibility
	of this approach by comparing a set of networks from different topics;
	for each pair, one of the networks belongs to a group of students
	(unknown expertise) and the other belongs to a group of teachers.},
